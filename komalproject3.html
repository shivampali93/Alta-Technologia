	<p>If you’re living alone, you may want the comfort a home security system can provide. If you’re currently enjoying a basic security system, adding home automation to your current home security system may also save you money.</p>
	<p>New technology, recent advancements, and more companies offering home automation packages helps make it more affordable now to turn any home or apartment into a smart home. You can start saving money on your utilities costs almost immediately, without any major renovations or work to your home.</p>

	<h5>Control the Temperature</h5>
	<p>The largest portion of your energy bill likely comes from your heating and cooling costs. The Maharashtra Electricity Board estimates the average Indian household pays about 2500-3000 Rs. a month for electricity, with a majority of those costs keeping the motors and compressors in heaters and air conditioners running. Unfortunately, many homes have inefficient systems that use a lot of energy to keep a home cool or warm, even when nobody is home. Home automation can help solve this problem.</p>

	<h5>Save Money on Lights</h5>
	<p>You know the scene. You’re about to leave for the day or head out on a much-deserved vacation and you’re frantically running through the house turning off lights so you won’t have to pay for wasted electricity. There’s no one in the bedroom, bathroom, or living room, so why are the lights on?

	On the flip side, it’s never fun to return home to a dark room or stumble in the hallway as you search for the light switch. You don’t want to leave the lights on all day, but you also don’t want to return home to a dark house. Home automation can solve both problems.</p>
